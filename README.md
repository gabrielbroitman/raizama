# RaizAma

Setting up RaizAma to work in Django is very easy. You need to make changes to requirements.txt, settings.py, and any app code that you want cached. These changes are covered in detail below.


## Run

It is best to use the python `virtualenv` tool to build locally:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py runserver
```
